Beach Safety Tips Web Application (Haskell + Scotty)

This is a lightweight web application built using the Scotty web framework (a Haskell DSL for building simple web servers). It serves both static HTML pages and a RESTful JSON API that provides essential beach safety information to users.

Functional Architecture for Safety
.Backend system implemented in Haskell using Scotty.
.RESTful API endpoints and static page rendering.
.Functional design ensures maintainability and safety.
.Focus on strong typing, immutability, and composability.


SafeShores demonstrates how functional programming in Haskell can power a clean, reliable web server for real-world use.
Built using Scotty, it combines declarative routing, type-safe JSON APIs, and static content delivery in one lightweight backend.
The project promotes modularity, maintainability, and clarity—core principles of Haskell-based web development.
With its current structure, SafeShores can be easily extended to support live data feeds, mobile applications, and larger deployments.



Final Thought:By leveraging Haskell’s strengths—type safety, purity, and simplicity—SafeShores proves that functional programming isn’t just academic, but practical and production-ready.

make sure you have haskell and scooty through cabal
run in localhost:3000
run these in powershell : cabal build
                          cabal run myScottyApp
